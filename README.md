A replacement for Phasmophobia's in-game journal

## What?

A replacement for Phasmophobia's in-game journal, redesigned for better UX. 

Phasmophobia — meaning the fear of ghosts — is a new co-op spook-em-up on Steam \[[link to store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/)]. The in-game journal is a book/diary used by hopeful haunted house hunters to ascertain which particular flavour of ghost is doing the spooking.

## How?

Left-click (or tap on touch devices) to mark a piece of evidence as 'found'. 
Right click (or hold on touch devices) to mark a piece of evidence as 'ruled out'.
Click with the same button again to un-mark it.

The list of ghosts below the input buttons will narrow based on your selections. A list of evidence still needed to confirm the type is displayed underneath (for clarity: it does not include in the list pieces of already-found evidence). 

Below this, the ghost's description, strength and weakness will be listed — sometimes paraphrased for brevity, or edited to correct grammar (sorry!).

I recommend having it open on a second screen, either another PC monitor or some sort of mobile device. 

## Why?

I disliked having to:
1. Open the journal, click to go to last page
2. Click through the options sequentially to find the correct one
3. Click through the list of remaining ghost possibilities
4. Remember them
5. Click backwards to reach the ghost pages of the above
6. Remember the remaining pieces of evidence needed to narrow down the choices
7. Click back to the last page, ready for next time
8. Hope you don't forget anything

The in-game journal also doesn't allow you to rule out pieces of evidence (occasionally useful).

## To-do

- ~~Update with new ghost types~~
- ~~Work out why the buttons are slighly cropped on the right-hand side when using my mobile browser~~
- ~~Crop/edit the SVG icons so that they fill their full canvas~~
- Add attribution text for the icons
- ~~Add an instruction line explaining left/right mouse interactions~~
- Add icons in the ghost results cards to show which pieces of evidence are remaining?
- ~~Add mobile view, with smaller (shorter) buttons and non-wrapping header so more ghosts show?~~
- ~~Write readme~~
